Apktool gets plenty of issue reports not related to apktool at all. People use the tool, but they don't know how to edit XML files, sign apks or even install them. It is funny that people go the hard way of re-engineering when they don't know how to work with app sources.

So... if you get some errors from apktool when decoding or building apk, then most probably this is a bug of apktool and you should report it. But if you have succeeded at decoding and building, but app doesn't work on your device, then I suggest you doing some tests:

  * don't do anything with original apk file, just install it using the same way as for apk built by apktool. If you will fail, then it can't be related to apktool, because you didn't even use it. Typical scenario: installing framework-res.apk by "adb push" command, which will certainly give you a lot of FCs.
  * unzip apk, remove META-INF dir, zip it back, sign and install. This will remove original signatures, but rest of the app will be intact. If you will fail at this point, you could be sure, that your problems are related to signing, not apktool.
  * rebuild apk without doing any changes to it ("apktool d" & "apktool b"). If apktool will succeed, but apk won't work, then it's probably apktool bug and you should report it.
  * if an app was working earlier, but after doing some changes to it it doesn't, this may be a bug of apktool, but more likely it's your fault.
